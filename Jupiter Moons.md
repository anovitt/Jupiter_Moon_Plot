Jupiter Moon Positions: Mathematica
===================
## The note book produces a "wavy-line" diagram of the four largest moons with respect to Jupiter as viewed from an input latitude and longitude on Earth.  Code is ##an application of the formulas given in Jean Meeus (1998). Astronomical Algorithms. Astronomical Algorithms book.

##The plot is helpful for identifying the moon's when viewing Jupiter, or for determining potential, "interesting" viewing times.  (Conjunctions, transits, ##occultations) The formula's used for the calculations are low accuracy, and are not precises enough for calculating the exact times of the phenomena of the ##moons.
